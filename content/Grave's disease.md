## Brief Overview

Grave's disease is an **autoimmune** disorder and the most common cause of [[Hyperthyroidism]]. In this condition, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, leading to an **excessive production of thyroid hormones**. The overactive thyroid gland results in hyperthyroidism and a range of symptoms that affect various body systems.

Eye symptoms such as lid retraction and exophthalmos are caused by lymphocytic infiltration of orbital fat, connective tissue and extraocular muscles.

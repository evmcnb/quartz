**Trait anxiety** - An individuals tendency to experience anxiety in response to stressors

**State anxiety** - simply the state of feeling anxious

### Anxiety disorder

A combination of high trait anxiety and a critical mass of psychosocial stressors can tip someone into excessive and persistent anxiety. Several thought processes drive this spiral:

- Avoidance - need to expose to stimulus to uncouple anxiety from it
- Attentional and cognitive bias - anxiety makes people pay attention to things and perceive threats more easily
- Anxious rumination - snowballing events 
- Low self worth - frequently comorbid with [[Depression]]
- Poor sleep - essential functions relating to cognition, emotional processing and memory

Benign tumours of the Schwann cells surrounding the auditory nerve - also called vestibular schwannoma

Found in the peripheral nervous system and provide the myelin sheath around the neurones

Acoustic neuromas are usually **_unilateral_**. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are associated with **_neurofibromatosis type II_**.

## Causes/Factors

- Sporadic
- Neurofibromatosis type II

## Symptoms

- Hearing loss - gradual/progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss often in high frequency sounds first
- Dizziness or imbalance
- A sensation of **_fullness_** in the ear
- Facial numbness/tingling - due to compression of the trigeminal nerve

## Signs

- Hearing loss - with preserved speech discrimination
- Abnormal vestibular function
- Facial weakness - compression of the facial nerve
- Tympanic membrane abnormalities

## Investigations

- Audiometry - sensorineural pattern of hearing loss
- Brain imaging - MRI to look for tumour 

## Management

- Conservative - monitor if there are no symptoms or treatments
- Surgery to remove the tumour - partial or total
- Radiotherapy 

## Complications/red Flags

- Vestibulocochlear nerve injury - permanent hearing loss of dizziness 
- Facial nerve injury with facial weakness

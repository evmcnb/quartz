- Chronic granulomatous disorder.
- Granulomas are inflammatory nodules full of macrophages
- Unknown cause
- Mainly respiratory but all organs affected
## Causes/Factors

- Aged 20-40 or around 60
- Women
- Black ethnic origin

>[!tip]
>The typical MCQ exam patient is a 20-40 year old black female presenting with a dry cough and shortness of breath. They may have nodules on their shins, suggesting erythema nodosum.
## Issues per organ

### Lungs
- Mediastinal lymphadenopathy
- [[Pulmonary fibrosis]]
- Pulmonary nodules

### Systemic
- Fever
- Fatigue
- Weight loss

### Liver
- Liver nodules
- [Cirrhosis](https://www.nosos.co.uk/snippets/cirrhosis/)
- Cholestasis

### Eyes
- [[Uveitis]]
- [[Conjunctivitis]]
- [[Optic neuritis]]

### Heart
- Bundle branch block & [[Heart Block]]

### Kidneys
- Stones (hypercalcaemia)
- Nephrocalcinosis
- [[Tubulointerstitial Nephritis]]

### Others but more non specific


> [!tldr] Lofgren’s Syndrome
> Refers to a specific presentation of sarcoidosis with a classic triad of symptoms:
>- Erythema nodosum
>- Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy 
>- Polyarthralgia (joint pain in multiple joints)

## Differentials
The top differentials for the varied presenting features of sarcoidosis are:

- [[Tuberculosis]]
- Lymphoma
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- [[HIV]]
- Toxoplasmosis
- Histoplasmosis

## Investigations

The blood test findings to remember are:

- Raised **_angiotensin-converting enzyme_** (**_ACE_**) (often used as a screening test)
- Raised **_calcium_** (**_hypercalcaemia_**)
- **_U&Es_** for kidney involvement
- **_Urine albumin-creatinine ratio_** to look for **_proteinuria_**
- **_LFTs_** for liver involvement

### Imaging

- **_Chest x-ray_** may show **_hilar lymphadenopathy_**
- **_High-resolution CT_** scanning may show **_hilar lymphadenopathy_** and **_pulmonary nodules_**
- **_MRI_** can show **_central nervous system involvement_**
- **_PET scan_** can show active inflammation in affected areas
## Management

**_Conservative management_** is considered in patients with no or mild symptoms.

**_Oral steroids_** (for 6-24 months) are usually first-line where treatment is required. **_Bisphosphonates_** protect against osteoporosis whilst on long-term steroids.

**_Methotrexate_** is a second-line option.

**_Lung transplant_** is rarely required in severe pulmonary disease.

## Complications/red Flags

Spontaneously resolves in 50% of patients. Overall mortality of less than 10%

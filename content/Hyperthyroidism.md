Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. There are various underlying causes of hyperthyroidism, with the most common being [[Grave's disease]].

Hyperthyroidism is **increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion** from the thyroid gland. Thyrotoxicosis is the clinical syndrome of excess circulating thyroid hormones **irrespective of source**. Hyperthyroidism is a subset of thyrotoxicosis 
## Causes/Factors

**GIST** mnemonic 

- **G**raves’ disease
- **I**nflammation (**_thyroiditis_**)
- **S**olitary toxic thyroid nodule. Usually benign adenomas that require surgical removal
- **T**oxic multinodular goitre

> [!info]
> Thyroiditis can often cause an initial period of **hyper**thyroidism followed by **hypo**thyroidism.
## Symptoms

- Anxiety and irritability
- Sweating and heat intolerance
- Tachycardia
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Insomnia
- Frequent loose stools
- Sexual dysfunction
- Brisk reflexes on examination
## Signs

- **Enlarged Thyroid Gland (Goiter):** The thyroid gland may be visibly larger than normal, causing swelling in the front of the neck.
	- Smooth = Grave's disease
	- Nodular = toxic nodules
	- Tender = thyroid inflammation
- **Tachycardia:** Abnormally fast heart rate.
- **Exophthalmos:** In Grave's disease, patients may have protruding or bulging eyes due to immune system attack on the eye tissues.
- **_Pretibial myxoedema_** discoloured waxy appearance over this area - specific to [[Grave's disease]]

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
- **Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU):** Measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs to determine its activity.
- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging test using sound waves to visualize the size and structure of the thyroid gland.
- **Antibody Tests:** To detect antibodies associated with Grave's disease.

### Radioactive iodine 

- Increased homogenous uptake - **Grave's disease**
- Area of intense uptake interspersed with reduce activity - **toxic nodular goitre** 
- Faint diffuse uptake - [[De Quervain's Thyroiditis]]
- No uptake at all - **inflammatory conditions**
- Single hot node with the rest of the gland suppressed - **toxic adenoma**


## Management

- **Carbimazole** is the first line anti-thyroid drug. Two treatment options:
	1. The carbimazole dose is titrated to maintain normal levels
	2. A higher dose blocks all production and levothyroxine is added and titrated to effect

>[!warning]
>
>The MHRA issued a warning in 2019 about the risk of acute pancreatitis in patients taking carbimazole. In exams, look out for a patient on carbimazole presenting with symptoms of pancreatitis (e.g., severe epigastric pain radiating to the back).

- **Propylthiouracil** is second line and works in the same way. Small risk of severe liver reaction. 

**Both can cause agranulocytosis** - this makes people vulnerable to infection. A **sore throat** is a key presenting feature. Need an urgent FBC and aggressive treatment. 

- **Beta blockers** - propanolol is usual as its non-selectively blocks adrenergic activity.

**Surgery is definitive option** - removing the whole thyroid gland and starting life-long levothyroxine 
## Complications/Red Flags

- **Thyroid Storm:** It is a rare and more severe presentation of hyperthyroidism with **_fever_**, **_tachycardia_** and **_delirium_**. It can be life-threatening and requires admission for monitoring.
- **[[osteoporosis]]:** Long-term hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.
- **Heart Problems:** Untreated hyperthyroidism can strain the heart, leading to heart rhythm abnormalities and potential heart failure.
- **[[Pregnancy]] Complications:** Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy requires careful management to prevent harm to both the mother and the baby.

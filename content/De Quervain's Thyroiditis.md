**_De Quervain’s thyroiditis_**, also known as subacute thyroiditis, is a condition causing temporary inflammation of the thyroid gland. There are three phases:

- Thyrotoxicosis
- Hypothyroidism
- Return to normal

The initial **_thyrotoxic phase_** involves:

- Excessive thyroid hormones
- Thyroid swelling and tenderness
- Flu-like illness (fever, aches and fatigue)
- Raised inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR)

It is a self-limiting condition, and supportive treatment is usually all that is necessary. This may involve:

- **_NSAIDs_** for symptoms of pain and inflammation 
- **_Beta blockers_** for the symptoms of hyperthyroidism
- **_Levothyroxine_** for the symptoms of hypothyroidism

A small number (under 10%) remain hypothyroid long-term.

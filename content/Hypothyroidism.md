- Underactive thyroid
- Hy**po** so low mood, slow, lethargic gain weight etc
- Most common in women and older people

## Causes/Factors

The most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis, also known as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]. Other factors and causes include:

#### Primary causes
- **Medications:** Certain drugs, such as lithium and amiodarone, can affect thyroid function.
- **Iodine Deficiency:** Inadequate intake of iodine, a crucial component for thyroid hormone production.
- **Radiation Therapy:** For head and neck cancers.

#### Secondary causes
Secondary hypothyroidism is often associated with a lack of other **_pituitary hormones_**, such as **_ACTH_**, referred to as **_hypopituitarism_**. This is rarer than primary hypothyroidism, and may be caused by damage to the pituitary in some way.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary in severity and may include:

- Weight gain
- Fatigue
- Dry skin
- Coarse hair and hair loss
- Fluid retention (including oedema, pleural effusions and ascites)
- Heavy or irregular periods
- Constipation

## Signs

- **Enlarged Thyroid (Goiter):** Swelling of the thyroid gland - caused by iodine deficiency
- **Slowed Reflexes:** Delayed reflex responses.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing hypothyroidism involves blood tests, including:

- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Measuring levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
- **Antithyroid Antibody Test:** To check for autoimmune causes.
- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging to assess thyroid gland size and structure.

## Management

Treatment of hypothyroidism typically involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy with synthetic thyroid hormones, such as **levothyroxine**. The goal is to restore thyroid hormone levels to normal and alleviate symptoms.

## Complications/Red Flags

Untreated or inadequately managed hypothyroidism can lead to complications, including:

- **Cardiovascular Issues:** Elevated cholesterol levels and an increased risk of heart disease.
- **Mental Health Problems:** Increased risk of depression and cognitive impairment.
- **[[Myxedema]]:** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by extreme hypothyroidism.

Exudative - high protein content (>30g/L)
Transudative - lower protein (<30g/L)

Transudate **tame** - fluids leak from intact vessels so **low protein** 

Exudates **extreme** - from pathological capillaries so **high protein**

## Causes/Factors

Pleural effusion can result from various underlying causes, including:

#### Exudative - related to inflammation 
- Cancer
- Infection
- RA

#### Transudative - fluid moving into the pleural space
- Congestive heart failure
- Hypoalbuminaemia
- Hypothyroidism
- Meigs syndrome

## Presentation 

- Shortness of breath
- Dullness to percussion
- Reduced breath sounds
- Tracheal deviation **away** from the effusion 

## Diagnostic Tests

- **CXR:** blunting of costophrenic angle, fluid in lung fissures, meniscus, mass effect
- **USS and CT** can detect smaller effusions, estimate volume and may identify cause
- **Pleural fluid analysis** requires a sample taken by aspiration or chest drain. This helps establish the underlying cause by measuring the protein content, LDH, cell count, pH, glucose and microbiology testing.

## Management

- **Conservative management** for small effusions. Treat underlying problem instead
- Pleural aspiration - needle through the chest wall, temporary relief
- Chest drain may be used but can reoccur when taken out. 

## Complications/Red Flags

Untreated or unmanaged pleural effusion can lead to serious complications, such as:

- **Lung Collapse:** Severe effusions can compress the lung, causing it to collapse (atelectasis).
- **Empyema:** Accumulation of pus within the pleural space due to bacterial infection.
- **Respiratory Failure:** Severe effusion can lead to difficulty breathing and reduced oxygen levels.

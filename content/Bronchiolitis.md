Infection of the bronchioles

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20240319161822.png|450]]

## Causes/Factors

- *Respiratory syncytial virus* 
- Occurs in children under 1 
- **Most common in children under 6 months old**
- Ex-premature babies
- Any chronic lung disease 
## Symptoms

- Coryzal symptoms - running/snotting nose, sneezing, mucus in throat and watery eyes 
- Signs of respiratory distress
- Poor feeding
- Apnoeas 

## Signs

When a virus affects adults the swelling and mucus are in proportion to the bronchioles so little noticable effect on breathing. In infants the smallest amount of inflammation can cause partial obstruction - **wheee and crackles** on auscultation
- Dyspnoea 
- Tachypnoea
- Raised RR
- Use of accessory muscles
- Nasal flaring
- Head bobbing
- Tracheal tugging
- Cyanosis 

## Management

Most infants can be manage at home with advice about when to seek further attention. Reason to admit:
- Aged under 3 months or any pre-existing condition
- 50-75% less of their normal milk intake
- Clinical dehydration
- RR above 70
- Oxygen sats below 92%
- Moderate to severe respiratory distress - deep recessions or head bobbing
- Apnoeas
- Patients not confident in their ability to manage at home 


### In hopsital 
Typically patients only require supportive management 
- Ensure adequate intake - orally, via NG or IV fluids. Important to avoid overfeeding as **this will restrict breathing**
- Saline nasal drops and suctioning to remove secretions - particularly prior to feeding
- Oxygen - titrate up to 92%
- Ventilatory if required - step-wise progression
Little evidence for nebulised salbutamol, bronchodilators, steroids or antibiotics 

## Palivizumab
- Monoclonal antibody that targets RSV
- Monthly injection given to prevent bronchiolitis
- Given to high risk babies - ex-premature and congenital heart disease 

## Complications/red Flags
- Rising $pCO_2$ shows that the airways have collapsed
- Falling pH shows that the $CO_2$ is building up and not able to buffer the acidosis - type 2 respiratory failure

Cancer of the glandular epithelium in the prostate. **Most common prostate cancer**

TNM staging 
## Causes/Factors

- Male%
- Ethnicity
- FH - BRCA1/2
- Pesticide exposure
- Increasing age
- Family history
- Black African or Caribbean origin
- Tall stature
- Anabolic steroids

Risk of cancer $\approx$ age

## Clinical Features

##### Local Primary Tumour Effects

- Frequency, urgency, dysuria
- Haematuria
- Urinary obstruction

##### Effects of Distant Metastases

- Bone - check calcium

##### Paraneoplastic Syndromes

Rare

## Diagnostic Tests

### Prostate exam

#### Benign
- Smooth 
- Symmetrical
- Central sulcus

#### Infected
- Enlarged
- Tender
- Warm

#### Cancerous
- Firm
- Asymmetrical
- Craggy/irregular
- Loss of central sulcus
- May be hard nodule

- **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test:** Blood test to measure PSA levels (elevated levels may indicate prostate issues). See [[Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia#^a09e56|here]] for details
- **Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a tissue sample to confirm cancer.
- **Imaging:** MRI, CT, or bone scans to determine cancer spread (if applicable).

## Management

1. **Active Surveillance:** Monitoring for slow-growing/early cancers.
2. **Surgery:** Radical prostatectomy to remove the prostate gland.
3. **Radiation Therapy:** Targeted radiation to kill cancer cells.
4. **Hormone Therapy:** Reducing testosterone levels to slow cancer growth.
5. **Chemotherapy:** For advanced or aggressive cases.

- **Urinary and Sexual Dysfunction:** Treatments may affect urinary and sexual function.
- **Recurrence:** Cancer may return after treatment.

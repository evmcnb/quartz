Glandular fever
Spread through saliva caused almost exclusively from EBV

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20230823125619.png]]
## Causes/Factors

- EBV virus colonisation, possibly at a older age than normal

## Symptoms

- Fever
- Sore throat
- Fatigue
- **_Lymphadenopathy_** (swollen lymph nodes)
- Tonsillar enlargement
- **_Splenomegaly_** and in rare cases **_splenic rupture_**
## Signs

- **Swollen Lymph Nodes:** Palpable and tender lymph nodes, especially in the neck and armpits.
- **Splenomegaly and Hepatomegaly:** Enlargement of the spleen and liver.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Physical Exam:** Evaluation of symptoms, particularly swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, and fever.
- **Monospot Test:** this introduces the patient’s blood to **_red blood cells_** from **_horses_**. Heterophile antibodies (if present) will react to the horse red blood cells and give a positive result.
- **Viral capsid antigen:** tests for specific EBV antibodies. IgM for acute infection, IgG for immunity. 
- **Liver Function Tests:** To assess liver function and detect any abnormalities.
- **Throat swabs**

## Management

1. **Rest:** Usually self limiting
2. **Avoiding Contact Sports:** To prevent risk of splenic rupture due to enlarged spleen.
3. **Avoiding Alcohol:** To avoid additional strain on the liver.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Splenic Rupture:** Enlarged spleen can be vulnerable to injury.
- **Glomerulonephritis**
- **Haemolytic anaemia**
- **Chronic Fatigue:** Some individuals experience fatigue for several weeks or months.

- Avoid ampicillin & amoxycillin with EBV as may cause rash

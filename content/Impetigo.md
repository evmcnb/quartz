Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection primarily affecting children, although it can occur in people of all ages.

Impetigo is typically caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes* bacteria (less commonly).

> [!warning]
> Children should be kept off off school during the infection due to the transmissibility.  
## Causes/Factors

The primary causes and risk factors for Impetigo include:

- **Bacterial Infection:** Entry of bacteria through cuts, scratches, or insect bites.
- **Close Contact:** Highly contagious and can spread through direct contact.
- **Warm and Humid Environments:** Conditions that favour bacterial growth.
- **Poor Hygiene:** Lack of proper skin hygiene.

## Non-bullous impetigo

- Typically occurs around the nose or mouth - exudate forms the golden crust
- Do not cause systemic symptoms 
- **Antiseptic cream** (hydrogen peroxide 1% cream) 1st line treatment 
- Oral flucloxacillin to treat more severe/wide spread infection
- Advise patient not to touch or scratch lesionss

## Bullous impetigo

**ALWAYS CAUSED BY STAPH. AUREUS**
- S. aureus produces toxins that causes fluid filled vesicles to form. These grown in size and then burst to form a golden crust
- They heal without scarring but can be painful and itchy
- More common in neonates and children under 2 
- They may be feverish and generally unwell. In severe infections when the lesions are widespread, it is called **_staphylococcus scalded skin syndrome_**.


## Complications 

- Cellulitis if the infection gets deeper in the skin
- Sepsis
- Scarring
- Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis
- Staphylococcus scalded skin syndrome
- Scarlet fever

- Beta lactam (cell wall synthesis inhibitors)
- Natural penicillins and synthetic (**amoxicillin** and **piperacillin**)

In an attempt to overcome $\beta$-lactamase resistance, penicillins have been combined with a $\beta$-lactamase inhibitors such as: **co-amoxiclav** (amoxicilliin + clavulanic acid), **Tazocin** (piperacillin + tazobactam)

Staph resistance is defined by stability to methicillin (IV only equivalent to **flucloxacillin**)


| Antibiotic | Indications | Considerations |
| ------- | -------|  ------ |
| Benzylpenicillin | Gram +ve streptococci, meningococcus, diptheria, anthrax, leptospirosis, Lyme disease | Give IV, poor absorption
| Phenoxymethylpenicillin | Prophylaxis in some diseases | | 
| Ampicillin/amoxicillin | Enterobacteria $\downarrow$ activity against Gram +ve, URTI, chest, [[Otitis media]], H. pylori | Ampicillin IV, amoxicillin PO
| Co-amoxiclav | Used if resistance to narrower-spectrum antibiotics, chest, pyelonephritis, cellulitis, bone |
| Tazocin | Broad spectrum including: Gram +ve, -ve, _Pseudomonas_ | Tazobactam has $\downarrow$ penetration of blood-brain-barrier. Myelosuppression with prolonged used |
| Flucloxacillin | $\beta$-lactamase resistant, Staph: skin, bone, post-viral pneumonia | |

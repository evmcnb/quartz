Polycystic kidney disease is an inherited condition that causes small fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys.

#### Autosomal Dominant (ADPKD)

- PKD1/2 mutation
- Small change - present as adults
- Rarely any symptoms with child with the condition. Most cases present between 30 to 60 y/o
- Cysts can also develop in liver and pancreas

#### Autosomal Recessive (ARPKD)

- Affected in womb
- PKHD1 gene mutation
- Under developed lungs
- 1/3 die in first month of birth

## Causes/Factors

- **ADPKD:** Caused by a mutation in either the PKD1 or PKD2 gene, which leads to abnormal cyst formation in the kidneys.
- **ARPKD:** Caused by mutations in the PKHD1 gene and typically manifests in infancy or early childhood.

## Symptoms

- **[[Essential hypertension|Hypertension]]:** Elevated blood pressure.
- **Pain:** Abdominal or back pain due to enlarged kidneys and cysts.
- **Hematuria:** Blood in the urine.
- **Urinary Tract Infections:** Due to cysts obstructing normal urine flow.
- **Kidney Stones:** Due to cysts interfering with urinary drainage.
- **Renal Dysfunction:** Impaired kidney function over time.


**Extra-renal manifestations** include:
- Cerebral aneurysms
- Hepatic, splenic, pancreatic, ovarian and prostatic cysts
- Mitral regurgitation
- Colonic diverticula

## Signs

- **Enlarged Kidneys:** Visible enlargement due to cyst growth.
- **Family History:** Especially in cases of ADPKD.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Ultrasound:** Imaging test to visualise cysts in the kidneys.
- **Genetic Testing:** To confirm the presence of PKD-related gene mutations.
- **MRI or CT Scan:** To assess kidney size, cysts, and complications.

## Management


- **Tolvaptan** (vasopressin receptor antagonist) can slow the development of cysts and the progression of renal failure in **autosomal dominant** PCKD
- **_Antihypertensives_** for hypertension (e.g., ACE inhibitors)
- **_Analgesia_** for acute pain
- **_Antibiotics_** for infections (e.g., UTIs or cyst infections)
- **_Drainage_** of symptomatic can be performed by aspiration or surgery
- **_Dialysis_** for end-stage renal failure
- **_Renal transplant_** for end-stage renal failure

## Complications/red Flags

- **Kidney Failure:** Gradual loss of kidney function.
- **Cyst Rupture or Bleeding:** Pain and complications due to cysts bursting or bleeding.
- **Urinary Tract Infections:** Frequent infections due to cyst obstruction.

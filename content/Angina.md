Pain due to partial blockage of a coronary vessel. Can be stable or unstable

- **stable angina** (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting
- **unstable angina** (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting ^1f93a5

Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.

## Causes/Factors

- [[Coronary Artery Disease#Causes Factors|Same as CAD]]

## Symptoms

- **Chest Pain:** Pressure, tightness, squeezing, or burning in the chest.
	- Pain subsides in stable angina
- **Pain Radiation:** May spread to the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder, or back.
- **Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing, especially during exertion.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired, especially with exertion.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Physical exam:** heart sounds, heart failure, blood pressure, BMI
- **ECG:** usually normal - _may_ show ST depression or flat or inverted T waves
- **Blood Tests:** FBC, U&Es, TFTs, lipids, HbA1C
- **Echo and CXR** to rule out gross defects and differential diagnoses
- **Angiography** - for typical and atypical angina if the patient _does not_ have a previous episode of proven [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]] 


## Management

5 Principles of management - **RAMPS**

- **R**efer to cardiology
- **A**dvise them about the diagnosis, management and when to call an ambulance (3 doses of GTN 5 minutes apart with no relief)
- **M**edical treatment - GTN spray, beta blocker, CCB (avoid with a reduced ejection fracture)
- **P**rocedural or surgical interventions - PCI, CABG
- **S**econdary prevention - Aspirin (75mg od), Atorvastatin (80mg od), ACEi (if [[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]], [[Chronic Kidney Disease]], or [[Heart Failure]] are also present), beta blocker

> Look for signs of previous scars - midline sternotomy for CABG, scars around accessible arteries for PCI and inner calves for saphenous vein harvesting

## Complications/red Flags

- **Heart Attack:** Angina may progress to a heart attack if blood flow is completely blocked.
- **Unstable Angina:** Severe chest pain at rest, indicating an increased risk of heart attack.

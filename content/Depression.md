Depression is a common **mood (affective) disorder** characterised by persistent low mood, low energy and loss of interest/enjoyment in everyday activities (anhedonia)

The onset of individual episodes is often related to stressful events or situations, and it usually runs a relapsing and remitting course.

## Causes/Factors

|               | Biological                                                | Psychological                                 | Social                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

| Perpetuating  |                                                           | - Failure to come with loss<br>- Ongoing loss |                                                       |
| Protective    |                                                           |                                               | - Current employment<br>- Support<br>- Marital status |
## Symptoms

> [!tldr] Core three symptoms of depression
> - Low mood
> - Anhedonia (loss of interest or pleasure in most activities that they previously enjoyed)
> - Lack of energy (anergia)

Other important symptoms are: 
- weight change
- disturbed sleep - sleeping late, waking early, not being able to fall back asleep
- psychomotor changes - movement slower or more restless
- reduced libido
- feeling of worthlessness of guilt 
- decreased concentration
- thoughts of self-harm
## Risk assessment

Important to conduct -
- Risk to self - self-harm, suicide, neglect (commonest in depression)
- Risk to others - when depression presents with psychotic features such as command hallucinations, may be a risk to others
- Risk from others - may be more vulnerable to abuse, criminal acts or neglect 

## Investigations

>[!tldr] ICD-10 Clinical diagnosis
>- The presence of symptoms for at least 2 weeks (this may be less if depression is severe)
>- The symptoms are not attributable to other organic or substance causes (e.g. normal bereavement)
>- The symptoms impair daily function and cause significant distress

- Patient-health-questionnaire-9 

- FBC - macrocytic anaemia 
- Thyroid function (hypothyroidism)
- Vitamin B12 - signs of paraesthesia and impaired memory
- Dexamethasone suppression test - Cushing's disease/syndrome. Obesity and proximal muscle wasting
- CT head may be performed in patients with atypical features and other signs indicative of pathology
## Management

1. **Mild** depressive episode, with or without **somatic** symptoms
2. **Moderate** depressive episode, with or without **somatic** symptoms
3. **Severe** depressive episode, with or without **psychotic** symptoms: these may be mood-congruent or incongruent psychotic symptoms
4. **Recurrent depressive disorder**: when one has two more depressive episodes

Management is based on the bio-psycho-social model. 

| Severity           | Short term                                                                                                             | Long term                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mild depression    | **1st line** - *low intensity psychosocial interventions*<br>Group CBT <br>Individual CBT<br>Counselling<br>SSRIs***** | SSRIs take around 4-6 weeks before any benefit is noticeable. In the first 3 weeks might make things worse<br><br>Assess for social support |
| Moderate or severe | **1st line** - combination of antidepressants, and high intensity psychosocial interventions                           | Risk assessment<br>Review response to treatment<br>Relapse prevention plan<br>Assess social support and previous issues flagged             |

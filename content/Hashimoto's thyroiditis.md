Hashimoto's Disease, also known as Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, is an **autoimmune** disorder that affects the thyroid gland. It is the **most common cause** of [[Hypothyroidism]], where the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages the thyroid, leading to reduced thyroid hormone production.

**_Hashimoto’s thyroiditis_** can initially cause a **_goitre_**, after which there is **_atrophy_** (wasting) of the thyroid gland.
